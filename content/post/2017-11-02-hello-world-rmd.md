In true coding fashion, here's the obligatory hello world post.  I've been typing hello world into programming langyages since I was 12 and that's usually as far as I got with coding until about 2 years ago when I started using PsychoPy.

The purpose of this blog is to document my PhD progress to try and encourage me to write.  I keep a research notebook but the handwriting is terrible and whenever I read back on it the content is incoherant.
