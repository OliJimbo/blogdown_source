Last night I submitted my first pre-registration to the OSF.io Pre-registration challenge.

The study is a Bayesian meta-analysis of studies using video game avatars to influence health behaviours and attitudes.  The process involved the following:

### Deconstructing a previous meta-analysis
Initially I wanted to learn meta-analytical methods by using previous data rather than beating my own data into submission.  This was a difficult process since:

+ the supplementary data was a pdf with that weird tendancy to select content in random patterns 

+ The methods section didn't provide enough detail to reproduce their methods

+ On acquiring the script that the authors used to transform their data, I was unable to reproduce their descriptive statistics.

That aside, I was able to build several Bayesian models and compare them using WAIC using the brms package.  I presented the results at a Bayesian Curriculum Conference in September (slides and scripts can be found here https://osf.io/sbh78/).

### Writing a PRISMA statement
The next step in the process was to nail down exactly what I was going to do in the meta-analysis.  This involved following the PRISMA guidelines to write a description of my rationale, search strategy, analysis methods, controls for risk of bias and study quality.  I followed the guidelines from @moher2015preferred for this and found it to be very useful for planning my project.

### Adapting the statement for OSF
This was an unexpected turn.  After spending a weekend writing my PRISMA statement I found that it did not map directly onto the OSF questions so I had to adapt a number of the PRISMA items for the OSF document.  I understand that the process is less rigid if you're not entering the pre-registration competition.

Now I wait!  As part of the competition each submission is reviewed for the degree to which it answers each of the questions.  This is not the same as peer review - i.e. the quality of the content is not reviewed.
